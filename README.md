# ⏳ Time Loop Explorers (Advanced Java Data Structures)

A complex, text-based logic game built with **Java** that focuses on sophisticated state management and time-manipulation mechanics. This project serves as a practical implementation of fundamental computer science concepts, developed with a modular 14-class architecture.

## 🛡️ Engineering & Data Structures
This project demonstrates the ability to build and manage custom data structures from scratch, proving a deep understanding of memory management and algorithmic logic:

* **Custom Linked List:** Implemented to manage game stages and the "Timeline" as interconnected nodes, allowing for dynamic progression and traversal.
* **Stack-Based Time Travel:** Utilizes **LIFO (Last-In-First-Out)** logic to handle the "Undo" and "Time Rewind" mechanics, enabling players to backtrack through previous game states effectively.
* **Modular OOP Design:** Leverage 14 distinct classes designed with inheritance and encapsulation to ensure a clean separation of concerns and maintainable code.

## 🎮 Game Features & Mechanics
* **Dynamic Exploration:** Navigate through various "Rooms" (Nodes) while managing resources like HP and Echo Stones.
* **Timeline Visualization:** A specialized module that traverses the game's history to provide a full report of every action taken by the player.
* **State Management:** Sophisticated inventory and player state logic that tracks progress across different "time periods."

## 📸 Technical Preview
Below is the application running in the terminal, showcasing the active state management and the "View Timeline" feature:

## 💻 Tech Stack
* **Language:** Java (JDK 11+)
* **Architecture:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
* **Core Concepts:** Pointers, Node Manipulation, Memory Management, and Algorithmic Logic.

## ⚙️ How to Run
1.  Navigate to the project directory.
2.  Compile the source files:
    ```bash
    javac *.java
    ```
3.  Execute the main application:
    ```bash
    java Main
    ```
